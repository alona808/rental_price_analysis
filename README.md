# Rental Price Analysis
## Data Science Challenge

To help assess own strategy of occupancy and revenue per available room to similar properties, this repository summarizes rivals' short-term rental prices and hosting occupancy.
Data from www.airbnb.com for the period of April 1, 2018, to May 31, 2018, is the basis of this repository.
Scraped Data processing included correcting spelling, removing outliers, filling in missing numbers, and removing unreliable data from the analytical table.

The purpose of the Tableau result report is to give data consumers the ability to analyze patterns and insights.
